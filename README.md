# Neural-Network-Character-Recognition
Using a simple neural network to recognise images from the MNIST data

Base code is from this excelent online book from [Micheal A. Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)

I have since been improving the speed and accuracy though suggestions in the book and my own ideas. 

To run, first download the MNIST data by running the batch script `get_data.sh`

The python script are writen for python 2.7
